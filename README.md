hosted on DO 💦 as a static Next.js app at /var/www/jonandjess/html

nginx config at /etc/nginx/sites-available/jonandjess

`yarn deploy` to trigger a build, export and scp `out/` into the server.

Yes, this is an overkill, but I wanted to try out Next.js' static export. We'll also probably extend the website soon so I'll be happy to have React to make all neat stuff Jess will design 👩‍🎨
